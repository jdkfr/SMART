SMART: Synergetic Multi-bit Arithmetic Recalibrated Transmission
SMART (Synergetic Multi-bit Arithmetic Recalibrated Transmission) is a unified compaction-encryption scheme that primarily transcends the additive overheads of conventional systems by synergistically integrating a 2:1 geometric encoder with a cryptographic 8$\times$8 Latin square, achieving a proven, lossless 3:1 bandwidth saving, where only one compact and encrypted bit is transmitted for every three input bits. The third bit is embedded algebraically into deterministic state evolution at zero transmission overhead. This stateful synchronization provides inherent cryptographic confusion and diffusion. We introduce a third primitive, illusion, to extend these principles by systematically reducing bandwidth. The scheme is deterministic, requires minimal memory (8 bytes), executes via ultrafast bitwise operations, and is formally proven to be bijective for perfect reconstruction, thereby eliminating the traditional security-performance trade-off and posing a cryptanalytic challenge equivalent to breaking a standard primitive. As an architectural leap, SMART delivers unmatched spectral efficiency and integrated security for next-generation IoT, edge computing, and Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC), and merits its evaluation in the given context.
